## Requirements
  There's no much requirements more than a browser. I checked it works on Google Chrome, Firefox and Safari; both on desktop and mobile versions. Bubs may appear.

## Documentation
### Google Fonts Api
  Google Fonts Api is used to get all the data that each font has to offer. You can get an Api key here: https://developers.google.com/fonts/docs/developer_api
  After you got a key and cloned the repository on your computer, place the key here:
  
  > app / modules / personalData.js
  
  Paste the key in the _googleApi_ variable.
